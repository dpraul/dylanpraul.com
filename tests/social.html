      content="Microsoft is banning police from using its facial recognition tech until federal regulation is in place, the company’s President Brad Smith announced on Thursday. “We’ve decided that we will not sell facial-recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology,” Smith said during a Washington Post event. Microsoft has been calling for federal laws on facial recognition since 2018, admitting that tech firms weren’t likely to regulate themselves."
